Explain GANs.

Explain Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for a university student who has completed an introductory course 
in machine learning and understands basic neural networks. Focus on describing the two main components (Generator and Discriminator), 
their adversarial training process, and how they interact to improve each other. Provide examples of their key applications

If all cats are mammals, and all mammals are animals, then all cats are animals.
If all birds lay eggs, and a robin is a bird, then a robin lays eggs.
If a number is prime and greater than 2, then it is odd.
The number 7 is prime. The number 7 is greater than 2. Is the number 7 odd?
Yes.

If all A are B, and all B are C, then all A are C.
If all dogs bark, and Fido barks, then Fido is a dog.
If a polygon has 4 equal sides, it is a rhombus.
If a polygon is a rhombus, then its opposite angles are equal.
A given polygon has 4 equal sides. Do its opposite angles need to be equal?

A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Calculate its speed just before hitting the ground. (Assume g = 9.8 m/s^2, ignore air resistance.)


A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Your goal is to calculate its speed just before hitting the ground,assuming no air resistance. 
First, state the principle of conservation of mechanical energy and the relevant formulas for gravitational potential energy (GPE) and 
kinetic energy (KE). Then, outline the steps to use this principle to find the final velocity. Perform the calculations, showing how you 
derive the final speed from the initial potential energy. (Assume g = 9.8 m/s^2).

What are the ethical issues with self-driving cars?


You are a chief ethicist for an autonomous vehicle company, presenting a detailed analysis to a board of directors who are concerned 
about public perception and liability. Discuss the "Trolley Problem" in the specific context of self-driving cars. 
Analyze a scenario where the car's AI must make an unavoidable choice between two harmful outcomes:
Swerving to hit a pedestrian who illegally jaywalked into the road.
Continuing straight, leading to a collision that causes severe injury to the vehicle's passengers.
Explain the ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism vs. deontology) that apply to such a dilemma, and 
the profound challenges in programming a 'moral' decision into an AI system, considering public trust, legal accountability, and diverse societal values. 
Your explanation should highlight the complexity and lack of easy answers.

Write Python code to evaluate and visualize a classification model.


Generate Python code using scikit-learn and matplotlib to evaluate a binary classification model and visualize its performance.
Your code should:
Import necessary functions: accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_curve, auc from sklearn.metrics, and matplotlib.pyplot.
Create two sample NumPy arrays: y_true (actual labels) and y_pred (predicted labels for a binary classification task), each containing at least 15 elements with 0s and 1s.
Create a y_proba array (probability estimates for the positive class) for the same samples.
Calculate and print the following metrics, clearly labeled: Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score, and F1 Score.
Generate and display an ROC Curve plot for the model. Ensure the plot has a title, labeled axes, and displays the AUC (Area Under the Curve) value.
Assume the positive class is represented by 1.

What is geoengineering?


You are an advisor to a global climate change policy panel, tasked with briefing international leaders on potential interventions. Discuss the concept of "climate engineering" (geoengineering) as a response to global warming. Focus on explaining two primary approaches:
Solar Radiation Management (SRM) – e.g., stratospheric aerosol injection. Describe how it works and its potential benefits and major risks.
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) – e.g., direct air capture. Describe how it works and its potential benefits and major challenges.
Conclude by summarizing the complex scientific, ethical, and geopolitical considerations that must be weighed before any large-scale implementation of these technologies.
